# The Becker-Posner blog repository
This repository contains data and code related to the article "Placing Two Authors in Their Vocabulary: Insights From a Semantic Network of the Becker-Posner Blog, 2004-2014".

The structure of the repository is as follows:

- The `data` folder contains source data extracted from the blog and stored in JSON format. Two versions are provided: a raw one, containing the entirety of the blog, and a clean one, in which user comments, announcement posts and replies to user comments have been removed.
- The `src` folder contains the notebooks and other source code used to analyze the blog data. Some results are stored directly in the notebooks and are not available as a standalone file.
- The `results` folder contains spreadsheets, text files, images and other files containing the results obtained through analysis of the blog.
